# WebMethodAdaptor in Syncfusion Vue Grid Component

The WebMethodAdaptor in Syncfusion Vue Grid facilitates data binding from remote services using web methods. This powerful feature enables efficient communication between the client-side application and the server. The WebMethodAdaptor, like the URL adaptor, sends query parameters encapsulated within an object named **value**. Within this **value** object, various datamanager properties such as **requiresCounts**, **skip**, **take**, **sorted**, and **where** queries are included.
