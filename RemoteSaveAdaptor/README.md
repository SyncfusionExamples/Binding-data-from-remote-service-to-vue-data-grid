# Binding and perform CRUD operation using RemoteSaveAdaptor

The RemoteSaveAdaptor in Syncfusion Vue Grid Component allows you to perform grid actions such as sorting, filtering, searching and paging primarily on the client-side while handling CRUD operations, such as updating, inserting, and removing data, on the server-side for data persistence. This approach optimizes your experience by minimizing unnecessary server interactions.
