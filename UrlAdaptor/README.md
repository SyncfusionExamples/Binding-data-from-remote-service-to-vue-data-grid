# UrlAdaptor in Syncfusion Vue Grid Component

The UrlAdaptor serves as the base adaptor for facilitating communication between remote data services and an UI component. It enables seamless data binding and interaction with custom API services or any remote service through URLs. The UrlAdaptor is particularly useful for the scenarios where a custom API service with unique logic for handling data and CRUD operations is in place. This approach allows for custom handling of data and CRUD operations, and the resultant data returned in the `result` and `count` format for display in the Syncfusion Vue Grid component.

This section describes a step-by-step process for retrieving data using UrlAdaptor, then binding it to the Vue Grid component to facilitate data and CRUD operations.
